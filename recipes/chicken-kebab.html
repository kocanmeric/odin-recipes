    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole-milk yogurt</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.</li>
        <li>Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
